# Data Structures
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data

## Linear data structures

* Array Data Structure:  elements are arranged in sequence  
* Stack Data Structure: elements are stored in the LIFO principle 
* Queue Data Structure: queue data structure works in the FIFO principle
* Linked List Data Structure: elements are connected through a series of nodes, each node contains the data items and address to the next node

## Non linear data structures

Arranged in a hierarchical manner
* Graph Data Structure: each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges
* Trees Data Structure: there can only be one edge between two vertices




| Linear Data Structures   | Non Linear Data Structures | 
|:------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| The data items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other. |  The data items are arranged in non-sequential order (hierarchical manner). |
| All the items are present on the single layer. |    The data items are present at different layers.   |
| It can be traversed on a single run. | It requires multiple runs. |
| The memory utilization is not efficient. | Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need. |
| The time complexity increase with the data size. | Time complexity remains the same. |
| Example: Arrays, Stack, Queue | Example: Tree, Graph, Map |


# Big-O Notation

Efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources that it requires to execute.
